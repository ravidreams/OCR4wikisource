# Version
1.62

This is a fork of https://github.com/tshrinivasan/OCR4wikisource . Please refer that repository for updated documentation.

This fork is heavily customized for Ravidreams' workflow and serves as his sandbox. So, please expect and report issues :)

Differences from Shrini's tool:

* Auto-update of tool
* Allows you to add a time delay in execution. This lets you initiate multiple sessions and run it all night while you sleep :)
* Minor fixes and conveniences.

To do:

* Add a timer based page skip for OCR uploads
* More :)
